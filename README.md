# C - Binary Trees

## Learning Objectives :page_with_curl: :heavy_check_mark:

* What is a binary tree
What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

## Header file :page_with_curl:

* [binary_trees.h](https://github.com/lataba/holbertonschool-binary_trees/blob/d0fec2438c4503f27d1a747acb79a55a0c5a81f1/binary_trees.h) Header file containing definitions and prototypes for all types and functions written for the tasks.
